- The database that is being used is Hibernate H2 and it is stored in DB.mv.db. The database is stored locally and it get cleared before every run of the main code


Can you provide the SQl used to create the table Customer (Hint: Hibernate is used for the object-relational-mapping)?

Hibernate:
    create table Customer (
        id bigint generated by default as identity,
        name varchar(255),
        primary key (id)
    )


Find a way to inspect the database tables being created and attach a screenshot of the database schema to your report. Do the created tables correspond to your initial thoughts regarding the exercise?

To display the database schema, i used the website "Dbdiagram". I got the sql got by changing "hibernate.show_sql" to true in persistence.xml. I had to remove 
hibernate and the job, familiy and person tables to get the correct result.
